This implementation of progressbar is intended to be extremely simple to use while providing a high quality user experience.

Features:
- Can add progressbar to existing m-files with a single line of code.
- Supports multiple bars in one figure to show progress of nested loops.
- Optional labels on bars.
- Figure closes automatically when task is complete.
- Only one figure can exist so old figures don't clutter the desktop.
- Remaining time estimate is accurate even if the figure gets closed.
- Minimal execution time. Won't slow down code.
- Randomized color. When a programmer gets bored...

Demo:
n = 1000;
progressbar % Create figure and set starting time
for i = 1:n
pause(0.01) % Do something important
progressbar(i/n) % Update figure
end
